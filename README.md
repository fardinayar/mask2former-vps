## Using Mask2Former for video panoptic segmentation in [cityscapes-vps](https://github.com/mcahny/vps)
The code is based on [MinVIS] (https://github.com/NVlabs/MinVIS) and [Mask2Former](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former), which is a video instance segmentation model without video training. Extending this work to video panoptic segmentation is straightforward, as the two tasks are quite similar.
